I am the type of person who gets a bit feisty – if someone else initiates it, then I’ll pipe up a bit.”</p><p>Former Boomers guard Shane said he saw the clip from the broadcast and was shocked that Barkley remembered him after so many years. While Team USA won the game, the match was instrumental in Shane’s journey to the NBA stage.</p><p>“It’s nice to know Charles hasn’t forgotten me after 25 years,” he said. “It was a cool shoutout and it was he recognised Shyla too.”</p><p>Barkley’s daughter, Christiana, has forged a career away from basketball and won’t be perpetuating the family feud.</p><p>“I am also a fierce competitor and I hate losing so that competitive nature and feistiness has definitely been instilled in me since I was a little girl and it’s one of my biggest strength in the game,” Shyla said.</p><p>“Ever since I was a young girl I’ve been really into goal setting. And one of my main goals was not only to be coached by my dad in the WNBL but to win a premiership with my dad.”</p><p><span class="_2wzgv D5idv _3lVFK"><span class=_29Qt8></span><span class=_3qqDc>Loading</span></span></p><p>Visa problems have delayed the start of Shyla’s WNBA career, with the teenager as yet unable to travel to the States. The Chicago club has already begun their WBNA camp with Heal feeling “a bit behind the eight ball”.</p><p>“I know it’s going to be a huge step and it’s something I’ve been preparing for. It has been a dream of mine since I was a little girl,” she said. “It will probably become more realistic once I get on the plane and get my visa.”</p><p>Source: | This article originally belongs to <a href=#>smh.com.au</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnlJaxbsDApaKenF2Wua1506GcZqudlrCsedKhsKWZXZ2yoriMq5yanKliwbB5xaijpaenYravecWaq6Gdoqh6p7HIrKuyZZakvLW%2F056nrGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./linda-tripp-dead.html><span>←</span><span>Bill Clinton Whistleblower Was 70</span></a>
