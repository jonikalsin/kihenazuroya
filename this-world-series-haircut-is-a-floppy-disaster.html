That is, until you see the back — which looks like a fat beaver tail creeping down the back of their heads and popping out of their baseball caps.</p><p>“It’s pretty popular,” says Dennie Moe Mitchell of Dennie Moe’s Superstar Barber Shop in Harlem.</p><p>He sees it as an updated version of the faux hawk: “People think they are doing something new but it’s all been done before, and barbers put their own spin on it.”</p><p>Houston Astros’ outfielder George Springer has enough overgrowth that it spills out of his hat and tickles the nape of his neck like an embryonic mullet.</p><p>Houston shortstop Carlos Correa has a closely cropped version. Many others have worn it this season, including Yankee slugger Aaron Judge.</p><span class=screen-reader-text>Previous</span><p><span>1</span> of <span>3</span></p><span class=screen-reader-text>Next</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/10/gettyimages-867107594.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/10/gettyimages-868006754.jpg><p><span class=screen-reader-text>Advertisement</span></p><p>The faux hawk — which is very similar to the “Odell Beckham” and “South of France” cut that Usher made into a sensation — is popular among young athletes, Mitchell says.</p><p>“It’s a little tighter on the sides,” he says of the style, for which he charges $25 for adults and $15 for kids. “I’d say we have about 10 requests for the faux hawk a day.”</p><p>As the World Series continues to hypnotize the country, Mitchell and other barbers might get even more requests. But hopefully not.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlfnh7kGlmbGlfqbWqv4ywpquklGLApr7InqpmoJGev6TB02agrGWRYrOtu8%2BpsGacmaiutMDEq2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./axel-lee-mcelhenney.html><span>←</span><span>Rob McElhenney And Kaitlin Olsons Net Worth Look At The Pairs Earning Sources</span></a>
