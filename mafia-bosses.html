But Profaci wasn’t as adept at keeping the peace as Corleone. His insistence on collecting a monthly fee from his fellow gang members led to the bloody Profaci-Gallo war in 1960, with the rebel faction spearheaded by the infamous <a href=# rel=noopener>“Crazy Joe” Gallo</a>. The war resulted in murders on both sides, and is similar to the conflict between the Rosato brothers and the character of Frank Pentangeli in The Godfather II.</p><p>Profaci died of natural causes in 1962 as the Profaci-Gallo war continued to rage. He thus didn’t live to see the Profaci Family become the Colombo Family when Joseph Colombo became boss in 1963.</p><p>And eight years after Profaci died, the power of the American Mafia began to do the same. The U.S. government passed the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act in 1970, which greatly expanded and intensified the ways in which prosecutors could convict mobsters, especially Mafia bosses.</p><p>Though the American Mafia continues to exist today, it’s nowhere near as powerful as in the days of mob bosses like Lucky Luciano, Carlo Gambino, and Vito Genovese, powerful kingpins whose names will remain infamous in the annals of crime lore.</p><p>After reading about some of America’s most notorious Mafia bosses, meet some of the most feared <a href=#>Mafia hitmen</a> to ever live. Then, discover the story of Philadelphia mob boss <a href=#>Joey Merlino</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyurcWimGaan6jApr%2BOamo%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./unlv-football-player-ryan-keeler-dead-at-20.html><span>←</span><span>UNLV Football Player Ryan Keeler Dead at 20</span></a>
