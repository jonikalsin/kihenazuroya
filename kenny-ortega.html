He rebounded by&nbsp;choreographing 1987’s Dirty Dancing. Kenny worked with <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Michael Jackson</a></strong> on his Dangerous World Tour in 1992, his HIStory World Tour in 1996 and his This Is It Concerts in 2009. Kenny’s major debut as a director came in 19923, when he helmed the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Bette Midler</a></strong> classic, Hocus Pocus. From there, Kenny was hired to direct and choreograph the High School Musical movies. Kenny directed a handful of episodes for television shows like Chicago Hope, Gilmore Girls and Ally McBeal.
