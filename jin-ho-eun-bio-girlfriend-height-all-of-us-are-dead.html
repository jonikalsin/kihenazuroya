But in addition to the protagonists, some of the supporting cast including our star Jin Ho-Eun were also put in the limelight for quite a while then.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Keep reading this Jin Ho-Eun Bio to learn more about him.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Jin Ho-Eun On All of Us Are Dead</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Netflix’s </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>All Of Us Are Dead</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> premiered on January 28, 2022, and it saw a group of students trapped on a campus premise left alone to fight zombies. It seems that the deadly virus outbreak at Hyosan High School had turned most of the students into brain-eating creatures, and those who survived were left without any food, cell phone service, or adults.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Their only hope was to wait for someone to rescue them, and keep surviving until then.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But thanks to the students coming from different backgrounds such as On-jo (Park Ji-hu) who has a firefight dad, they were able to re-group and rescue their friends.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jin Ho-Eun’s character comes into this scene as a 17 years old freshman in the archery club.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For those wondering, yes, the plot is similar to that of the popular South Korean zombie horror film </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Train From Busan</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, and we’re not the only one who thinks so. As seen in the trailer, one of the characters in the series references the film as well.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This season, Jin was joined by supporting casts — Lee Eun-Saem (Park Mi-Jin), Ha Seung-Ri (Jang Ha-ri), Kim Bo-Yoon (Seo Hyo-Ryung), Ahn Seung-Kyoon (Oh Joon-Young), Ahn Ji-Ho (Kim Cheol-Soo), Shin Jae-Hwi (Chang-Hoon) and Kim Jin-Young (Kim Ji-Min).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Among them, Lee Eun-Saem (Park Mi-Jin) and Ha Seung-Ri (Jang Ha-ri), were from the archery club too.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Whan to see some behind-the-scene pics? Well, do check Jin Ho-Eun’s IG posts from Jan 2022. Also, over one of the posts, he recalled his time filming </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>All Of Us Are Dead</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> captioned, “I was grateful to be able to be together, and I was also grateful to be able to make happy memories.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The renewal of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>All Of Us Are Dead</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> for its second season wasn’t announced at the time of writing this article.</span></p><h3><b>Jin Ho-Eun Girlfriend</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jin Ho-Eun appeared to be single like most of his co-stars as of 2022. Guess, the actor was still working his way up in the entertainment industry and didn’t prioritize relationships then.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, we did check all of his socials and found no traces of his love life. Seems like it’ll be a long time before we get to meet his girlfriend.</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is Jin Ho-Eun Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jin Ho-Eun garnered a net worth of under $200 thousand by 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The actor first dreamed about joining the entertainment industry back when he was still in high school.
