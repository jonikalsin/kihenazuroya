They are currently living in an 1887 cottage which they renovated on the season 1 finale of Big Texas Fix. They shared on Instagram, “Hope everyone can tune in to watch this tired 1887 house turn into a home. We loved the final product so much we moved in”.</p><p>Michael and Ashley are experts on renovating the houses that survived the hurricane in 1900 that nearly wiped Galveston off the map. Meanwhile their company, Save 1900 is dedicated to restoring historic houses built on the Texas island city during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p><p>So, for those of you who are newly introduced to him, Meet Michael Cordray. Here we discuss his married life, net worth, career, and his ethnicity.</p><h3><strong>Michael Cordray On Restoring Galveston</strong></h3><p>Michael Cordray and his wife Ashley Cordray are the hosts of the Restoring Galveston. They met each other when both of them were working at Kirby Inland Marine. Both of them attended the same university Texas A&M Galveston and majored in the same program Maritime Administration.</p><p>They reportedly began dating in 2011. The dating couple flipped their first only three months into dating.</p><p>Three years into dating each other, they exchanged their wedding vows on 4 April 2014.</p><p>Michael and Ashley are the parents of two kids. They welcomed their daughter Elle Lane on 25 November 2019. It was the time when they were filming the second season of Restoring Galveston. “I went to the hospital and got induced while the crew was on break,” Ashley shared. She opted not to go on maternity leave either. “I had our daughter on a Thursday and was back on set when they returned three days later”.</p><p>Then, they welcomed their second daughter Elle Lane Cordray on 25 November 2019. Elle weighed 8lbs 6oz and measured 21 inches.</p><p>Before the new show on the Magnolia network, they previously did a house-flipping show for HGTV and DIY Network.</p><p>They are passionate about preserving old homes that survived Galveston’s devastating 1900 hurricane as well as other decaying buildings that would later lay the foundation for the city’s restoration. Producers of HGTV were seeking their next reality stars for home renovations in Galveston not long after the couple started Save 1900. At first, Ashley was hesitant since they lacked sufficient expertise. But Michel thought they could do a home renovation reality show.</p><p>They got in touch with the directors, who then filmed a sizzling clip for HGTV. A pilot was ordered by producers for DIY Network, HGTV’s sister network. However, Michael and Ashley Cordray took out a sizable debt to buy the eight residences they would repair and sell on the show in order to make the show work. In addition, they had to dig deep for the best interior design steals.</p><p>They restored eight separate homes for eight episodes of their TV show Big Texas Fix on HGTV and DIY networks.</p><h3><strong>Michael Cordray Education</strong></h3><p>Michael Cordray graduated from Texas A&M Galveston in 2006 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Maritime Administration.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Michael Cordray&nbsp;Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>With a whopping net worth of $2 Million, Michael Cordray has a sound financial life.</p><p>Michael’s family had owned old in Galveston since the 1800s and home restoration is in his blood. His wife Ashley suggested that they began flipping relic houses. They did it while keeping their full-time jobs. Later, both of them decided to quit their jobs to fully focus on their joint venture.</p><p>Michael shared a story about house flipping. He said, “When we started, we both had corporate jobs and we were working on the houses on the weekends and it was just going really slow. We’d do like a house a year and Ashley would kind of harass me every day to quit my job so we could do this full-time and after a year and a half of being asked every day to do that I kind of gave in. There were so many houses in Galveston that were older and awesome that needed love and we just couldn’t work on as many as we wanted to if we still had full-time jobs”.</p><p>He added, “You know, houses were being torn down due to neglect and stuff like that. Many of these houses had survived countless hurricanes and the 1900 storm and all these massive events, and you know they’re just being lost to people not caring about them so we decided to quit our jobs and care about them”.</p><p>Then, in 2016, they founded their real estate and restoration company, Save 1900. Michael shared that the best part of his job was seeing the end result, a house in terrible shape turn back into a home. He also stated that his biggest mentor was his last boss from the corporate world JD Futch whose care for customers was unmatched and inspiring.</p><p>Their dreams of flipping and renovating houses have got them several honors. They received the 2016 GHF Sally B Wallace Historic Preservation Award, 2017 GHF Sally B Wallace Historic Preservation Award, 2018 Galveston Landmark Commission Preservation Award, and 2019 Galveston Landmark Commission Preservation Award x 2.</p><p>They never step back from involving themselves in philanthropic works.
