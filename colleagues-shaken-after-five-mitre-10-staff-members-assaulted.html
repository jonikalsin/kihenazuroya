Five staff members of a North Island Mitre 10 store were assaulted yesterday after confronting a customer allegedly shoplifting.
The incident began at 2.45pm when a staff member of Mitre 10 Levin spotted a woman believed to be stealing a product from the store.
The store’s general manager, Emma van Echten, said when the woman was approached by the staff member and asked to return the item to the shelf, she reacted angrily."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
