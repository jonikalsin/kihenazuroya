Funny enough, Peyton wouldn’t have two of those rings if he never met Ashley.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Ashley will also undoubtedly be cheering him on in a very different way when he hosts the 2023 Country Music Association Awards on Wednesday, November 8. The former NFL player returned for his second year co-hosting with&nbsp;<strong>Luke Bryan.&nbsp;</strong>It’ll definitely be a night of country music to remember. Find out more about Ashley and her marriage to Peyton here!</p><h2>She and Peyton Started Dating in College</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Ashley grew up in Memphis, Tennessee, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Heavy.com</a>. She was introduced to Peyton by her parents’ next-door neighbor during the summer before Peyton’s freshman year in college. The unnamed neighbor had played football at the University of Texas and hosted Peyton on a recruiting trip. This mysterious matchmaker thought that Peyton and Ashley would be the perfect fit — and they were right.</p><h2>Ashley and Peyton Have Twins Together</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>The couple was married on March 17, 2001 — aka, St. Patrick’s Day. March is quite the lucky month for Peyton and Ashley because, on March 31, 2011, Ashley gave birth to twins —&nbsp;son <strong>Marshall Williams</strong> and daughter <strong>Mosley Thompson.&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>Ashley Talked Him Out of Retiring in 2011</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Peyton won his first Super Bowl ring in 2006 while playing for the Indianapolis Colts<strong>. </strong>He stayed with the team for five more years until a series of neck surgeries forced him to miss the 2011 season. After his time with the Colts, a then-37-year-old Peyton considered hanging up his helmet. “Ashley was the one that was saying, ‘Peyton, you’ve got to try. You’ve got to try.'” Peyton told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sports </a><i>Illustrated’s</i>&nbsp;<strong>Peter King</strong>. “Once I did it, I was going at it, and then I started seeing a little bit of light there. So, yeah, she was the one who kind of pushed me through it.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“And really, I had a peace about it. I had a peace. Because, I had this unbelievable string of health for 20 years—since I was 15 years old as a sophomore in high school,” added Manning. “So who was I to complain now that I’m injured? I’ve given it as good a run as I can give it. I’ve got kids now. I had a peace about it. So I didn’t feel like I had to play to get another win or a touchdown. But she’s like, ‘You’ve got to try.’ So I was glad that she pushed me to do it. Once I did it, I was going at it, and then I started seeing a little bit of light there. So, yeah, she was the one who kind of pushed me through it.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Peyton eventually retired after securing his second NFL championship with the Colts, capping an extraordinary career on the gridiron.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Peyton-Manning-shutter-embed.jpg><h2>Ashley Is an NBA Team Owner</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Ashley’s interests in sports aren’t limited to just football. In 2012, she joined a group that included <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Justin Timberlake</a></strong>, <strong>Penny Hardaway,</strong> and former Congressman <strong>Harold Ford Jr.</strong> to become a minority owner of her hometown’s basketball team, the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Memphis Grizzlies</a></strong>, according to the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Denver Post</a>.<img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>She’s Active in Charity Work</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>In addition to her work as co-owner of the Memphis Grizzlies, Ashley is busy in the philanthropy world. She is the co-founder of the PeyBeck Foundation along with her husband, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sportskeeda</a>. PeyBeck “helps underprivileged and at-risk youth in Louisiana and Indiana in the state of Tennessee.” She also participates in charity events to raise money for breast cancer since her mother battled the disease. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Ashley worked with Peyton to serve over 600 meals to frontline healthcare workers at a hospital in Heritage, Tennessee.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8%2BesK2nnmK6orrNoqWgZaOlvLa%2FxGZocm5pZYJ3ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./buba100x.html><span>←</span><span>Buba100x Age, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</span></a>
