<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Justin Schade Obituary, Glencoe Minnesota, Death, Funeral And Visitation</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Justin Schade Obituary, Death Cause –&nbsp;</strong>It is with heavy hearts that we gather to remember and honor the life of Justin Schade, a remarkable young man whose journey left an indelible mark on the hearts of all who had the privilege of knowing him. Justin’s time with us was filled with an undeniable love for sports, a passion for video games, and an infectious spirit that brought boundless joy into our lives.</p><p>Justin’s parents, Willard and Carol Schade of Kansasville, along with his grandmothers, Jeanette Brown and Elsie Schade, hold dear the cherished memories they created with their beloved son and grandson. In addition to his immediate family, he leaves behind a sister, Doreen (Dana) Kamp, and a brother, Glenn (Jane) Gehrke, who will forever remember the remarkable bond they shared with Justin. Justin’s warmth and his ability to connect with others have left an enduring impact on his extended family, including aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, and many close friends.</p><p><strong>A Passion for NASCAR and Video Games</strong></p><p>One of the most distinctive facets of Justin’s life was his fervent passion for NASCAR and his unbridled enthusiasm for playing video games. Those who had the privilege of knowing him were well aware of his deep love for these interests. Justin’s passion was both contagious and captivating, making every moment spent with him an unforgettable experience. He had a unique talent for infusing joy and excitement into the lives of those around him, creating lasting memories that we will forever cherish.</p><p>While we mourn Justin’s untimely departure, we also fondly recall the loved ones who preceded him in death, including his grandfathers, James Brown and Rueben Schade. Their memories continue to reside within the depths of our hearts, serving as a poignant reminder of the importance of cherishing the moments we have with our loved ones.</p><p><strong>A Celebration of Life</strong></p><p>A memorial service to celebrate Justin’s life will be held at Schuette-Daniels Funeral Home on Saturday, July 28, 2007, at 12 noon. The service will be officiated by Rev. Jim Volkert, who will guide us in paying tribute to Justin’s life. At a later date, Justin will be inurned at St. Mary’s Catholic Cemetery in Burlington, Wisconsin.&nbsp;For those who wish to offer their condolences, share memories, and provide support to the Schade family, there will be an opportunity to meet with them at the funeral home on Saturday, starting at 10 a.m. and continuing until the commencement of the service.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaKKlqMGquoysmqGZlJp6sK7IrayaqqlitK2xzZymnmWdnruvsdKoq5pllJqutbSMn6ynnaKWuW6tzZ1kr6GjnsGiwMiopWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cotwsolds-roman-swords.html><span>←</span><span>English Metal Detectorist Discovers Ancient Roman Swords</span></a>
