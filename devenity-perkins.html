She is of American nationality and is of mixed ethnicity. In terms of siblings, Devenity has only one sister, Daniella, who is also a social media star like Devenity, and no brothers.</p><p>Devenity, who is only 15 years old, collaborated with her sister Daniella Perkins to showcase her dancing abilities, and she quickly grew a sizable fan base.</p><p>She hasn’t revealed much, but she was born and raised in Fullerton, California. Devenity’s sister posted pictures of her beloved father and bid him farewell on Instagram on February 5, 2019. The caption revealed that their father died on January 17th, which caught the entire family off guard. Daniella did not discuss the cause of death, but she did say that the incident was traumatic and difficult to recover from.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marrieddivorce.com/uploads/images/devenity-perkins-father.jpg><p>Devenity, who is a private person, has not discussed personal matters such as her educational background. She has a height of 5 feet 1 inch (1.55 meters).</p><p>It’s exciting to see Devenity succeed in the acting industry despite the fact that she’s only a teenager. She is undeniably pleased to be cast as a princess in Nickelodeon’s Knight Squad.

In 2016, she was in a relationship with Landon Barker, a reality star the same age as Devenity. These two collaborated and appeared in many of Devenity’s TikTok videos that she shared with her fans. Some of the videos even showed Devenity kissing her boyfriend, implying that these young lovebirds found love at a young age.</p><p>It is unknown how the couple split up, but rumors of Landon’s infidelity circulated widely on the Internet. Landon, on the other hand, addressed this in a comment on one of her Instagram posts, revealing that he was the one who broke up with her and never cheated on her.</p><p>Even after the breakup, Devenity posted a photo of herself with Landon on Instagram with the caption “dis my ex,” implying that they have worked out their differences and are now good friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marrieddivorce.com/uploads/images/devenity-perkins-boyfriend.jpg><p>Because Devenity hasn’t introduced any new men to her fans on social media, it’s safe to assume she’s not dating anyone right now!</p><table border=0 width=100% cellpadding=0 align=left><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h4 class=top>Quick Information</h4></th></tr><tr><td width=65%><table border=0 width=100% cellpadding=0><tbody><tr><th scope=row width=109>Date of Birth</th><td width=159>August 13, 2003</td><th scope=row width=109>Age</th><td width=159>17 Years 11 Month(s)</td></tr><tr><th scope=row width=109>Nationality</th><td width=159>American</td><th scope=row width=109>Profession</th><td width=159>Social Media Personality</td></tr><tr><th scope=row width=109>Marital Status</th><td width=159>Single</td><th scope=row width=109>Divorced/Engaged</th><td width=159>Not Yet</td></tr><tr><th scope=row width=109>Boyfriend/Dating</th><td width=159>Landon Barker (Split)</td><th scope=row width=109>Gay/Lesbain</th><td width=159>No</td></tr><tr><th scope=row width=109>Ethnicity</th><td width=159>Mixed</td><th scope=row width=109>Net Worth</th><td width=159>Not Disclosed</td></tr><tr><th scope=row width=109>Height</th><td width=159>5 Feet 1 Inches (1.54 Meters)</td><th scope=row width=109>Siblings</th><td width=159>Daniella (Sister)</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><p>I hope you enjoyed the article and please leave your questions in the comments section.</p><p>Thank you very much</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6XCra3Rp5ytr5%2Bnwal6wqikaJyVq7KvtdOyZKmdoqC2r7%2BO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-did-prince-fielder-retire-from-the-mlb.html><span>←</span><span>Why did Prince Fielder Retire from the MLB?</span></a>
