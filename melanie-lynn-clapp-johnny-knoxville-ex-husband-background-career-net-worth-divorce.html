However, as of this writing, the rumor is still false. Jessica and Johnny never responded to the rumor. A court granted their divorce in March 2008, two years after they first filed for it. Their daughter is in their joint custody.</p><p>Jessica Simpson revealed that Melanie and Johnny had an emotional affair in 2020, more than ten years after their divorce.</p><p>Everyone struggled to understand this because it perplexed everyone. Jessica’s response, on the other hand, clarified things. Jessica largely avoided sexual activity until she married. She believed that a couple’s relationship was formed through sexual activity. She quickly realized, however, that a physical relationship was nothing in comparison to an emotional connection or desire.</p><p>She also had a strong emotional connection with Johnny. She did not take action, however, because both were already married to their respective partners at the time. Jessica felt a wave of remorse after cheating on her former partner because she preferred emotional connections to physical ones.</p><p>Melanie nearly disappeared from the public eye after her divorce. While her ex-husband remarried and divorced, there was no comparable news about her. According to some, she may have chosen to keep her private life facts to herself, despite claims that her marriage to the actor and his gambling addiction devastated her. Either scenario could be correct, but based on what is known, she vanished from public view immediately after her divorce from her ex-husband.</p><p>Johnny later married Naomi Nelson and had two sons, Rocko Akira and Arlo Clapp. Naomi and Johnny tied the knot in September 2010. Johnny recently filed for divorce in 2022, after 12 years of marriage. Furthermore, Johnny provided Naomi with a list of divorce reasons, including irreconcilable differences, as well as records indicating the couple’s separation on September 4, 2021.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimkZ63or%2FUqZyrnpGjwG%2BvzqZmpp2clruqsYylsKemXZi5orzPZqGooJ6jxm63zaivr6GcobJusddmn66rkpa7pXnBmpqkn6Kkwq%2BwjJyYq52Vp3qvsdNmrqiqpJ16pbXVqKmcnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./all-about-vivienne-kove-net-worth-relationship-career.html><span>←</span><span>All About Vivienne Kove | Net Worth, Relationship, Career</span></a>
