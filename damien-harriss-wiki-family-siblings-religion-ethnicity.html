There is no information on if the football player has a brother or sister. Damien appears to be his parents’ child, as he has two sisters, the names of whom are unknown. Several internet users, however, were baffled, believing Damien had a sibling named Najee Harris.</p><p>The confusion arose because they shared surnames. Not only that, but they work in the same industry, which has led some to believe Damien and Najee are brothers. They are said to be attending the University of Alabama together. Whatever the case may be, Damien and Najee are not brothers. Not to add that Najee plays for the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League (NFL).</p><h2><span id=Examine_Damien_Harriss_Family_Life>Examine Damien Harris’s Family Life</span></h2><p>Damien Harris was born in Richmond, Kentucky, on February 11, 1997.
