McGregor had an illustrious career in the sport and became a two-division champion for the UFC. His UFC career has been </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>full</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true> of high-profile battles, wins, and losses, making him one of the most recognizable characters in combat sports today. With his fighting style, attitude, and personality, Conor McGregor has quickly become one of the </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>biggest</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true> faces in UFC history.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Breakdown of Events Before UFC 303</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The excitement that preceded UFC 303 was palpable, with McGregor about to grace the octagon once more. However, an unusual set of circumstances scuttled McGregor's involvement in UFC 303. McGregor said he broke his pinky toe while preparing for that fight, and it would not be quite ready in time for Chandler, either.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The UFC worked with&nbsp;Conor his doctors, and his team before deciding to delay the fight. McGregor's absence from UFC 303 will be a bummer for fans and the promotion, especially considering they had his return to the octagon scheduled after he broke his leg against Dustin Poirier last July. Not to mention Chandler, whom McGregor was expected to face and who hadn't fought since November 2022, excitement for the encounter had reached fever pitch.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Relevant Statements</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The former two-weight champion posted a statement on his social media bemoaning the fact he has been forced to withdraw from the anticipated return fight and needs more time for an injury picked up in training.&nbsp; "I'll be back," thanking people for their kind words as they wished him a full recovery before adding with confidence in one final post, finishing how ever many fights are still left on his resume. In his statement, McGregor gave a little more of an inside look into how he is mentally handling this latest setback and showed how he views the injury and pulling out.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Impartial Analysis of Impacts and Consequences</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The fact that McGregor did not fight during UFC 303 has had far-reaching impacts on him and the organization. While fans were upset they had to wait a little longer for his return, it also cost the organization financially, as McGregor's fights are typically some of their most lucrative paydays. Also, this year's biggest event without a star like McGregor never put all in it, and it no doubt has some effect on excitement and sales revenue from the audience at UFC 303.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0misn5tfrLW6ecOim2abn6O8s3nMnJ6rnZekv26w0ainZqelqXqwsoyunZxlY2WA</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ankita-lokhande.html><span>←</span><span>Sushant Singh Rajput Former Girlfriend, Ankita Lokhande Net Worth And Relationship</span></a>
