Half Ounce was on the rise to becoming a huge presence in the rap industry, and it’s devastating he was taken so soon from us. Here’s everything you need to know about Half Ounce.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Half-Ounce-L.A.-Rapper-Shot-Killed-embed-1.jpg><h2>Half Ounce is not the first rapper to be killed in L.A.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>There’s been a startling pattern of rappers being murdered in Los Angeles County. Rappers <strong>PnB Rock</strong>, 30, and <strong>Kee Riches</strong>, 23, were both gunned down in LA in September during separate incidents. Last December, rapper <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Drakeo the Ruler</a>, </strong>28, was stabbed during a fight at a music festival. Rapper <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Pop Smoke</strong></a>, 20, was shot to death in a home invasion in February 2020. Fans will also remember that rapper <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nipsey Hussle</strong></a>, 33, was shot and killed outside his clothing store in March 2019. None of the incidents are believed to be connected.</p><h2>Half Ounce was married</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>It’s been confirmed that Half Ounce was on the phone with his wife when he was murdered. According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Fox 11</a>, the rapper’s spouse heard him being shot over the phone, and she rushed to the scene. Her identity is unknown.</p><h2>Half Ounce had children.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Half Ounce had three children at the time of his death. He was a father to a 9-month-old son, a 2-year-old son, and an 8-year-old daughter, according to Fox 11. Half Ounce also had a fourth child on the way, as his wife is currently pregnant.</p><h2>Half Ounce released his new album in August.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Half Ounce’s latest studio album,&nbsp;<i>Rhythm & Gunz</i>, came out on August 19. It featured nine tracks. It was his fourth studio album, after 2019’s&nbsp;<i>There Goes Da Naybahood, </i>2018’s <i>Blood Money, and </i>2017’s<i>&nbsp;Nayba.Hood.Politics.</i></p><h2>Half Ounce’s new song was supposed to come out this month.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Half Ounce’s upcoming song, “Drop The Ball”, has been set to come out on October 14. His <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>final post</a> on Instagram was promoting the song. It’s unclear if “Drop The Ball” will still come out in the wake of Half Ounce’s tragic death.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K1orjFZqauppOaenWElWpqbWhf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cynthia-lynn-dead-hogans-heroes-helga-dies.html><span>←</span><span>Cynthia Lynn Dead Hogans Heroes Star Dies At 76 Hollywood Life</span></a>
