On April 30, Boulder Police conducted their “long-awaited ‘formal interviews'” with the Ramseys for over eight hours. The next day, the Ramseys broke their four-month silence and took part in another nationally televised interview with CNN.&nbsp;In a subsequent&nbsp;interview with local media outlets including <a href=# rel=noopener>9News</a>, John Ramsey said, “Let me address very directly, I did not kill my daughter JonBenét … JonBenét and I had a very close relationship, I will miss her dearly for the rest of my life.”</p><p>If you or anyone you know has been a victim of sexual assault, help is available.
