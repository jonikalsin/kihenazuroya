However, TikTok also has an oft-ignored dark side that needs urgent addressing.</p><p>The latest demonstration of TikTok’s ugly side is the alleged April 24th ‘National Rape Day’. Per a viral image referencing the date, a group of six men posted a video claiming that on April 24th ‘it’s legal to sexually assault anybody’. The image further claims that the men gave ‘tips’ on how to carry out the assault.</p><p>This piece will provide further insight into the April 24th TikTok trend and TikTok’s reaction to it.</p><h3>Some TikTokers have advised women to take extra precaution on April 24th</h3><p>As expected, the alleged April 24th ‘National Rape Day’ has met universal condemnation. The criticism has extended to other social media platforms, including Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.</p><p>It is clear that the alleged ‘Rape Day’ is a hoax, but TikTokers are advising women to take extra caution on that day. A large section of online users fears that women will experience assault on that day. Some suggestions floated around include encouraging women to carry weapons and to walk in groups.&nbsp;</p><p>Other TikTokers have posted veiled threats aimed at would-be perpetrators of sexual crimes on April 24th. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Some law enforcement officers have chipped</a> in by posting videos threatening potential criminals with arrest and prosecution. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@la.tania.ftn2 posted a TikTok video advising women to stay indoors</a>:</p><p>“This is a video going around on TikTok of disgusting men – rapists, child molesters, predators, just disgusting human beings – and they literally came up with a date to go around and rape women and children. You literally heard me right: women and children. You guys, stay indoors. I know it happens every day, but they are literally making this date especially for that. Carry what you got to carry because I think the fuck not. Stay safe, please share this.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><p>Everybody hopes that nobody follows through with the alleged assault. As societies observe Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, we should take steps to ensure that nobody experiences sexual assault.&nbsp;</p><p>You are encouraged to report any video that promotes ‘National Rape Day’ or any other form of sexual assault occurring at any time.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><h3>TikTok denies that the original video promoting ‘National Rape Day’ exists on its platform</h3><p>As people continue to share warnings about the April 24th TikTok trend, internet sleuths carry on with their search for the original video containing the threat. So far, no one has found the video.</p><p>According to a TikTok spokesperson speaking to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">USA TODAY</a>, the video doesn’t exist on the platform. The spokesperson sent USA TODAY an email stating:</p><p>“Keeping our community safe is our priority, and we do not tolerate content that promotes or glorifies non-consensual sexual acts including rape and sexual assault. While we have not found evidence on our platform of any videos related to the subject, our safety team is remaining vigilant and we will remove content that violates our policies.”</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Thenetline.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tooaNiwamxjJqjpZ2XmrFuusCtoKimkaF6s63PnmSdmaliv6aty2aroqOkpLi0edKhppyjmaO0bq3Pq6ClZWJpwal506ucp5xdmsWxuMCipZ6cXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fred-ebb.html><span>←</span><span>Fred Ebb</span></a>
