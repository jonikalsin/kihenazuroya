While not going into any details, Kremer said they were OK right now.</p><p>Though he was born and raised in Stockton, California, Kremer is the son of Israeli parents and identifies strongly as Israeli himself. He spends time each year in the Jewish state and is fluent in Hebrew.</p><p>Kremer found out Sunday he would be starting Game 3. Orioles manager Brandon Hyde checked in with the pitcher during a conversation at breakfast Monday.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/NYPICHPDPICT000014069107.jpg><h2 class=block-info-box__heading>Israel-Hamas war: How we got here</h2><p>2005: Israel unilaterally <a href=#>withdraws from the Gaza Strip</a> more than three decades after winning the territory from Egypt in the Six-Day War.</p><p>2006: Terrorist group Hamas wins a Palestinian legislative election.</p><p>2007: Hamas seizes control of Gaza in a civil war.</p><p>2008: Israel launches military offensive against Gaza after Palestinian terrorists fired rockets into the town of Sderot.</p><p>2023: Hamas launches the biggest attack on Israel in 50 years, in an early-morning ambush Oct. 7, firing thousands of rockets and sending dozens of militants into Israeli towns.</p><p>Terrorists killed more than 1,200 Israelis, wounded more than 4,200, and took at least 200 hostage.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was quick to announce, “<a href=#>We are at war</a>,” and vowed Hamas would pay “a price it has never known.”</p><p>The Gaza Health Ministry — which is controlled by Hamas — reported at least 3,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 12,500 injured since the war began.</p><p>“Gave him my support and sympathies for him and his family that’s involved, and he seemed OK,” Hyde said. “Obviously, he’s very disturbed and there’s a lot of things going on. But I didn’t sense that it was going to affect … I think he’s really looking forward to pitching tomorrow so I didn’t think it was going to affect him.”</p><p>Along with the manager, Kremer said just about everybody in the Orioles clubhouse has checked on him at some point over the last couple of days.</p><p>“I’m very grateful for that,” Kremer said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/NYPICHPDPICT000053034916.jpg><p>Kremer is 13-5 with a 4.12 ERA in 32 starts this season, which included both of the Orioles’ clinching games. He allowed one run in five-plus innings of an 11-inning win over Tampa Bay on Sept. 17 that secured a playoff spot, and tossed 5 1/3 scoreless innings Sept. 28 against Boston in the team’s 100th win — clinching the AL East title.</p><p>Kremer was the first Israeli ever taken in baseball’s amateur draft when the San Diego Padres got him in the 38th round in 2015. Kremer stayed in school then, but signed the following year after the Dodgers got him in the 14th round. He went to Baltimore as part of the 2018 trade that sent Manny Machado to Los Angeles, and made his big league debut with the Orioles in 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGlmaXFfpL%2Bqu8ueqmaclZa7brfRnqSeql2ptaq6yqKloGWfm3qnrcyio7JlmaN6qr%2FRmpylZZGdsqKwjKidZp6Zp8C1ec%2BlmLKnlpt6tMDAq6to</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dashaun-morris-ii.html><span>←</span><span>DaShaun Morris II | Fan Arch</span></a>
