However, at the eleventh hour, her name was dropped from the play, and she was humiliated by her teacher for wearing short skirts. In an interview, while talking about the incident, she said,<br><p>I used to wear my skirt too short, and you’d get a behavior point every time you were seen with your skirt short. All the girls did it but I was quite a big character in school so I used to get made an example of. I cried when I got kicked out. The teacher who was running the musical said it helps to be an actress, doesn’t it, to turn the waterworks on?”</p></li><li>She posts various videos on her social media accounts, where she films herself singing covers and playing the guitar.</li></ul><ul><li>Due to an obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Free faced difficulty in eating cake with her bare hands while shooting an episode of the horror series ‘Servant’ (2019). In an interview, she said,<br><p>I have OCD when it comes to food. I have to cut everything up into particular shapes and sizes, and eat it all in a certain order. So I’m a nightmare to take out for dinner.”</p></li><li>She is extremely fond of wearing accessories and has 7 piercings on her ear. In an interview, she revealed that she takes off her accessories only for work. She said,<br><p>I have rings on every finger and 7 piercings in my ear. I sleep in all my jewellery and I only take it off for work.”</p></li><li>While describing her eating habits in an interview, she said,<br><p>To be honest, I’m not really a breakfast person. I don’t really eat too early in the morning, but I am a late-night eater.”</p></li><li>Surprisingly, Free also loves to eat tomato soup, just like her character Leanne in the series ‘Servant’ (2019). In an interview, she also revealed that hates eating leeks. She said,<br><p>I’m a big fan of tomato soup as well. I’m happy to have toast and tomato soup for dinner… I’m just lucky that Leanne’s favourite dish isn’t leeks because I’m terrified of leeks. I hate them. So thank God tomato soup was her signature dish.”</p></li><li>While describing her favorite breakfast, she said,<br><p>Spinach and mushroom on toast with baked beans and hash browns. No matter where I am in the world, I will always try and locate this breakfast.”</p></li><li>As a music enthusiast, she has formed a band along with her friends, Joe and Dylan. In an interview in January 2021, she revealed that she intended to release an extended play.</li></ul><h3>Related posts:</h3><a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Bob Saget Wiki, Age, Death, Wife, Family, Biography & More"><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-default><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/images/default.png alt="Default Thumbnail" data-pin-nopin=true style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Bob Saget Wiki, Age, Death, Wife, Family, Biography & More</span></a> <a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Shree Saini Wiki, Height, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography & More"><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-default><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/images/default.png alt="Default Thumbnail" data-pin-nopin=true style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Shree Saini Wiki, Height, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography & More</span></a> <a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Nick Bare Wiki, Age, Height, Girlfriend, Wife, Family, Biography & More"><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-default><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/images/default.png alt="Default Thumbnail" data-pin-nopin=true style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Nick Bare Wiki, Age, Height, Girlfriend, Wife, Family, Biography & More</span></a> <a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Amy Dorris Wiki, Age, Boyfriend, Husband, Children, Family, Biography & More"><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-default><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/images/default.png alt="Default Thumbnail" data-pin-nopin=true style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Amy Dorris Wiki, Age, Boyfriend, Husband, Children, Family, Biography & More</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamZy7ornEm6CoZpOkunC6xKWjZqyZnLKzecWrnJ5n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lara-fraser-bio-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html><span>←</span><span>Lara Fraser | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</span></a>
