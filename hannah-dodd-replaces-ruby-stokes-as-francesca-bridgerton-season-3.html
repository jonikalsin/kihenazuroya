Francesca is the third daughter and third-youngest Bridgerton sibling. She only featured in two episodes of Season 1, when she was in London learning to play the piano with the kids’ Aunt Winnie. She had a bit more screen time in Season 2 and appeared in three episodes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/hannah-Dodd-Replaces-‘ruby-Stokes.webp><p>Francesca’s absence has been a running joke among “Bridgerton” fans, despite the fact that book readers are aware that she has her own novel later in the series, which Netflix could be building up to.</p><p>“Francesca Bridgerton is a bit puzzling within her chatty, extroverted family,” according to her character description. Despite her reclusive character, she plays along to get along in society events, reinforced with caustic wit and pragmatism that confounds the fickle tonne while seeming to gain notice when she least wants it.”</p><p>Dodd previously appeared in “Find Me in Paris,” “Harlots,” “Flowers in the Attic: The Origins,” and “Anatomy of a Scandal,” in which she played a younger Sienna Miller. In “Enola Holmes 2,” which will be released on Netflix in July, she’ll have a supporting role opposite Millie Bobby Brown.</p><p>Season 3 of “Bridgerton” will begin production in the summer of 2022. <strong><a href=#>Seasons 1-2 of Bridgerton</a></strong> are now available on Netflix.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong></p><ul><li><a title="The Hating Game: What You Must Know Before Watching!" href=# rel=bookmark>The Hating Game: What You Must Know Before Watching!</a></li><li><a title="‘Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore’ When Will It Release?
