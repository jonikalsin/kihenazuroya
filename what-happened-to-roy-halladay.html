data-mce-fragment=1 data-id=8658ec5b-3f2d-4b94-b4a0-1d5e2f6b2c72>His flying included extremely steep turns, ascents and higher G maneuvers This gave rise to serious questions about the acceptability of what he was doing as a pilot.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1 data-id=8658ec5b-3f2d-4b94-b4a0-1d5e2f6b2c72>There were also mentions of his plane flying at low altitudes and making maneuvers not approved

Events</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1 data-id=47a793b8-cf68-4078-8c94-c4322bd9bf24>Halladay, a licensed private pilot with multiengine and single-engine ratings who had logged approximately 750 hours of

at around 180 feet over water.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1 data-id=141577e3-ab63-49c4-b314-97363b649610>Industry Response</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1 data-id=bac3d691-17dd-452c-b081-912703e65ed7>Halladay's crash was an important one not just because of the legacy the pitcher left behind, but because it finally called attention again to the very rare but very serious risks of flying so low to the ground, a topic the AOPA Air Safety Institute took up shortly after.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1 data-id=bac3d691-17dd-452c-b081-912703e65ed7>Low-altitude flying is understand to entail an extra layer of risk that is not present during the high-altitude flight, and it was mentioned that training as pilots may have received focused on the latter at the expense of the former.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1 data-id=116f5f7c-1679-46b3-9b34-bbc9b9bba33b>The NTSB release on Roy Halladay's crash suggests a combative, impaired pilot who was dabbling with multiple drugs, and never fully grasped the dangers of low-altitude flying.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1 data-id=116f5f7c-1679-46b3-9b34-bbc9b9bba33b>While the exact last cause of the crash remains to be determined, the sequence of events that led up to the the tragedy serve as a reminder to follow aviation rules and a wake-up call to the repercussions of flying recklessly.</p><p class=postsid
