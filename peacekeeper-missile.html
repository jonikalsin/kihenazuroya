Image Source: <a href=#>Wikimedia Commons</a></p><p class=dropcaps>The Peacekeeper missile is anything but peaceful.</p><p>These eight lights beaming down on the Marshal Islands like a scene from War of the Worlds is not a sight you’d ever want to see in person. Thankfully, the above photo captured only a test of the eight re-entry vehicles from a single <a href=#>Peacekeeper missile</a> — a missile so deadly the United States agreed to destroy all of them by 2003 as part of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty II.</p><p>Peacekeeper missiles <a href=#>are more than 70 feet long and weigh more than 198,000 pounds</a>. They can carry up to 11 nuclear warheads that each split and strike different targets, as seen in the image above.</p><p>When a Peacekeeper is launched, it is shot 50 feet into the air via pressurized gas, boosted into space on a rocket and guided toward the target with an internal navigation system. The top of the rocket (the re-entry section) detaches and the warheads go their separate ways as they re-enter the atmosphere. This all happens in a matter of seconds.</p><p>The first successful test flight (without attached nuclear warheads) was in 1983, launched from the Central Coast of California. The Peacekeeper traveled 4,190 miles and then dropped six re-entry vehicles on the Kwajalein Missile Test Range near the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean. The undated image above shows a similar launch, but with eight re-entry vehicles.</p><p>Had this not been a test, and had the re-entry vehicles been armed with warheads, they would have had the blast power of 25 Hiroshima-sized bombs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyxscCcnKSdlaWys3nMoqqsoZya</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./salt-lake-city-school-district-recommends-four-school-closures.html><span>←</span><span>Salt Lake City School District recommends four school closures</span></a>
