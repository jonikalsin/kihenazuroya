Life in Levittown changed in 1957 when Bill and Daisy Myers moved in.
They’d bought their home in Levittown, Pa., from the Wechslers, a Jewish couple who’d decided to move on and say their farewells to suburbia."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

And so, in 1957, 10 years after the first Levittown was built, the first black couple moved in.</p><p>The Wechlslers’ phone rang shortly after the town found out who was moving in. The call was from one of their old neighbors — but when they picked up the phone, <a href=#>the voice on the other end</a> was just screaming, “You N*****-loving Jewish motherf*****s!” It was the first of many calls to come.</p><p>When the Myers moved in, the whole community was waiting for them. A white cross had been set up on their front lawn, and Confederate flags hung from their neighbors’ windows — even though they were in Pa. And, outside their front door, a whole mob was waiting.</p><p>Rocks were hurled through their window. Some people threatened to place a bomb in their home, others to murder the Myers or the Wechslers, or even to kill their two young children.</p><p>When the police arrived at the scene, the mob hurled stones to chase them away. One bashed a young sergeant in the head, cracking a bloody trail on his skull and leaving him unconscious on the Myers’ front lawn.</p><p>Levittown unraveled in a single night. The peace and the security that had made suburbia a little piece of paradise erupted into violence and hatred the second a black family moved in.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony4tculoJqlXaGyt7XTrWZs</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-did-conor-mcgregor-drop-out-of-ufc-303.html><span>←</span><span>Why Did Conor McGregor Drop Out of UFC 303?</span></a>
