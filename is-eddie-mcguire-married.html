Can we add ‘husband’ to his list of titles?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eddie McGuire has been married to his wife Carla since 1997. Carla, who is the mother of Eddie’s two sons, was deeply involved in the fashion and social scene and is still regarded by many as a heavyweight of Australian fashion.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>For someone so quick to share his opinions, Eddie McGuire is hesitant to share information about his family with the world. Let’s find out what there is to know about his wife, Carla, their marriage, and their family.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Carla McGuire?</h2><p>Eddie is married to a woman called Carla, who he met sometime in the 1990s at a mutual friend’s party and married in 1997. Carla was born on <a href=# rel=noopener>13 July 1980</a> and has spent all of her life in Australia.&nbsp;</p><p>In true McGuire fashion, Carla keeps the details of her private life under wraps and as a result, little is known about her. She does not have any social media presence — at least not under the username ‘Carla McGuire’, that is.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Carla has a background in fashion and started a clothing brand of her own called ‘Endless Spirit Clothing’. After heading up the brand and being its manager and buyer for seven years she <a href=# rel=noopener>sold the business</a> in order to focus on her growing family.&nbsp;</p><p>Eddie said of his wife’s business, “She’s in charge of acquisitions, I just work to pay for it.” Though it’s not clear if this was really the case, <a href=# rel=noopener>Carla has opened up</a> about why she sold ‘Endless Spirit Clothing’.</p><p>She said, “What we do is teamwork. Travelling seven months a year with my business was going to be too much with a family and I didn’t want to do it with the children anyway. So I sold the business.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Eddie and Carla McGuire’s Marriage&nbsp;</h2><p>On <a href=# rel=noopener>8 February 1997</a>, Eddie and Carla got married at St. Peters Church, on Toorak Road, in Melbourne, Australia. They married in a lavish ceremony and Carla walked down a <a href=# rel=noopener>rose-strewn aisle</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Their wedding was attended by several <a href=# rel=noopener>Channel Nine reporters</a> including Kellie Sloane, Steven Jacobs, Tara Brown, and Larry Emdur.</p><p>This church is well-known in the area and is a <a href=# rel=noopener>popular wedding venue</a> for many. St. Peters was constructed in 1876 and is a bluestone and sandstone structure complete with stained glass windows and impressive timberwork.&nbsp;</p><p>Carla and Eddie are a well-respected couple who have even helped their famous friends with <a href=# rel=noopener>marriage advice</a>. Karl Stefanovic told the <a href=# rel=noopener>Daily Mail</a>, “During the worst of it, Eddie and Carla McGuire, I could not fault them as people or as friends. For me they were rocks and their advice was incredible.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Does Eddie McGuire Have Children?</h2><p>As far as the general public is aware, Eddie and Carla have a happy marriage. Along the way, they had two children.&nbsp;</p><p>Eddie and Carla share two sons, one named Joseph and the other named <a href=#>Xander</a>. Joseph was born in 2001, goes by ‘Joe’, plays cricket, loves football, and has an interest in media.</p><p>Xander — whose real name is Alexander — was born in 2003 and was bitten by the media bug when he was just 12 years old. He is best known for playing the role of Charlie Hoyland in the iconic Aussie soapie ‘Neighbours’ but he has a few other titles under his belt.</p><p>It is easy to see that Carla — and Eddie — have done a great job in raising their children. Many would agree that Carla made the right decision in selling her business to raise her boys.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jqKqZp2Umbamecycnq6hopp6rq3Rq6CenF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gina-rodriguez-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Gina Rodriguez Net Worth : Career &amp;amp; Charity</span></a>
