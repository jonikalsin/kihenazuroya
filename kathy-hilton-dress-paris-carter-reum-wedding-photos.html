Paris officially married <strong>Carter Reum</strong> on November 11, and their wedding was nothing short of perfect. Kathy showed up to the wedding with her hair and makeup done, wearing a white wrap dress adorned with pink hearts. Once she got inside the ceremony, she changed into her glamorous mother-of-the-bride dress. The black gown featured a seashell design and had sheer sleeves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kathy-Hilton-Paris-Wedding-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Overall the look was stunning, but still allowed for Paris to shine in her Oscar De La Renta <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wedding gown</a>. To complete her look, Kathy had her hair styled in curls. She arrived to the nuptials alongside her husband, <strong>Rick Hilton</strong>, and they posed for photos inside the ceremony together, as well. Kathy looked like the ultimate proud mama as her daughter married the love of her life on such a special day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kathy-Hilton-Paris-Wedding-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Kathy is always rocking some sort of stunning outfit, so we were not surprised when she rocked this beautiful outfit to the wedding. Luckily, we were able to see a slew of looks from Kathy leading up to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the wedding</a>, considering Paris and Carter had a ton of pre-wedding events. Earlier in October, Paris had an Alice in Wonderland-themed <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>bridal shower</a> that was of course, fabulous, and Kathy rocked a pretty pink dress. The chiffon mini dress was light pink and featured bright pink flowers all over it while the bodice featured a cape style top. Her waist was cinched in while the skirt was flared and flowy. Kathy topped her look off with a pair of pale pink, pointed-toe satin pumps. <span>Kathy was joined at the bridal shower by her Real Housewives of Beverly Hills castmates including her sister, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kyle Richards</strong></a>, </span><strong>Lisa Rinna, Dorit Kemsley, Garcelle Beauvais</strong><span>, and </span><strong>Crystal Kung Minkoff</strong><span>.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kathy-Hilton-Paris-Wedding-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Luckily, we can see even more details from the wedding as it was filmed for a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Peacock series</a> about Paris’s life, titled, Paris in Love. Other celebrity guests at the lavish nuptials included&nbsp;<strong>Kim Kardashian, Kyle Richards, Emma Roberts, Paula Abdul&nbsp;</strong>and many more. Kathy must be one proud mama!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye5BrZqSZpJ3GbrTIpauopl2Zv6a%2F0manmqqZqHqkrdGtnKtloprCrnnWnpudoZ6cerG0zq2mrGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./christian-mccaffrey-height.html><span>←</span><span>How tall is Christian McCaffrey?</span></a>
