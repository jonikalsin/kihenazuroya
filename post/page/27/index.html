The National Heritage Board reports that Singapore’s national anthem made its debut in 1958.

The song is simply titled “Majulah Singapura,” or “Onwards Singapore,” and it became the national anthem the following year.
Said read these words, he stated in 1967 (per National Heritage Board), at the theater itself, and considered them perfect building blocks for a song that espoused the virtues of togetherness and pride that defined the people of Singapore.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jaidyn Alexis Wikipedia, Age, Net Worth: Meet Blueface Girlfriend</h2><time>Jul 15, 2024</time>
