The cause of her death in 2019, for instance, is not a matter of public record. One thing she did share publicly was her love of horses. “My love affair with horses started about the time I learned to walk,” she wrote in a&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;post about the 37th birthday of one particular horse she raised. Given the frequency with which horses appear on “Yellowstone,” it’s easy to imagine she was a natural fit on-set.</p><p dir=ltr>Olmstead’s career trajectory, meanwhile, seems to have kicked off during her time at Salt Lake City-based Westminster College. There, she participated as a student in an acting class. Later, after finishing graduate school, she became romantically involved&nbsp;with her former acting instructor.</p><p dir=ltr>Although what she brought to the series isn’t clearly stated, both her work experience and these details about her personal life make it clear that “Yellowstone” was well within Melanie’s wheelhouse.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue9OrnKecmaO0cMPHqGSwmaNixqa4y6iurKyfo7K0ecyeo5qmmZp6sLjMrKuemZRitbDDjJ2gnWWYmr9usMSaq6FlkZuzpq%2FTZquhnV2otbDDjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./scott-boucher.html><span>←</span><span>Scott Boucher</span></a>
