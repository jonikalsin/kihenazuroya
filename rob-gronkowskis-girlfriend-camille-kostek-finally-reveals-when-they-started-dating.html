They’ve been linked for years but have never publicly told the story of how they first started dating!</p><p>“It was November, 2013 and we were at a Goodwill event. It was right before Thanksgiving. So we were filling turkey baskets for families who are less fortunate. And yeah so <strong>Rob [Gronkowski]</strong> and I, you know, I feel like with dating apps these days and people sliding in the DMS and stuff, I’m so happy that like, with my love story, we met in person at a charity event. I feel like it’s very rare these days to meet at the library and the grocery store or wherever else, especially in this <a href=# title=Coronavirus><strong>COVID</strong></a> world where you can even see half your face out. So I feel like it’s made dating a lot harder,” <strong>Camille</strong>, 28, said on SiriusXM’s This Is Happening with Mark Zito and Ryan Sampson.</p><p><strong>Rob </strong>wrote his phone number down and had a teammate give it to her at the event. At the time, <strong>Camille </strong>was a cheerleader for the Patriots, and was worried she’d be breaking a rule by pursuing anything with a player.</p><p>“I was like, ‘Oh no, no, no, I can’t take this. I can’t take his number.’ And then he was like, ‘just take it,’ and I was like, ‘okay,’ and I put it in my pocket. And I, I never spoke about it again. I didn’t make it locker room talk. I never spoke about it. You know, some of my captains now are probably like, ‘girl, what?’ So, and then I just, I sat on it for a couple of days and then I FaceTimed him,” <strong>Camille </strong>explained.</p><p>She expressed she was worried this was some sort of trap to get her in trouble for contacting a player. When she called him for the first time, she thought it might be a fellow cheerleader getting her in trouble! However, it was obviously Rob.</p><p>“And I was like, ‘hello.’ And he was like, ‘who is this? You called me.’ And I was like, ‘um who’s this?’ And I could tell it was his voice. And he like peeked his head over. And he had just gotten back from a Texans game. So he had like a suit on and everything. And he was like, ‘hello?’ And I was like, ‘it’s <strong>Camille</strong>.’ And he was like beaming. ‘He was like, Oh my God, I never thought you’d call me.’ And then little did we know 2021 Tampa Bay Buccaneers. I’m here as his girlfriend almost eight years later. It’s kind of crazy,” Camille said.</p><p>She was then asked if there might be an engagement ring in their future! She responded, “I’m hoping that he’s smart enough to ask my friends or my sisters [for ring advice]. For me right now we’re focusing on the big [Super Bowl] ring.”</p><p>The couple once revealed if <a href=#>they hook up before his games or not!</a></p><p><strong>Rob </strong>will be playing with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the <a href=# title="2021 Super Bowl"><strong>2021 Super Bowl</strong></a>!</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Justjared.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6toqp%2BXeqi%2BzqeiqK%2BjoLa0ecaiqaWeop6yr7CMnJimoZyhsm63zqyrnqNdm7avrculsGaqlauyorjSZq6hnZ5iwamx2GaqrZmiqbKlecOaq6Kml2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./larry-bird-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Larry Bird Net Worth: Earnings &amp;amp; NBA [2024 Update]</span></a>
